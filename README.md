Coding Bee
==========

Jupyter notebook for MCing the Coding Bee.

Problems live at the top of the notebook. Test cases live in tests.json.

### Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

cd javascript
yarn install
```

### Run

Start the notebook locally via:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Run Python questions in a new cell below the notebook.

Run other languages in https://repl.it/

If you want to run JavaScript against test cases, you can paste the function into `javascript/scratch.js` and run it there. (TODO: this could benefit from something more slick!)
